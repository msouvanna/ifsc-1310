     <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
     
     <h3>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h3>
     <p>Technically, yes. But economically, it isn't feasible. The problem of the absence of an airlock 
     can be solved by simply venting the entire cabin. That's how it was done in Gemini and Apollo. But 
     in reality, it's not practical. It would be cheaper to build and launch a new Hubble than to design 
     and build the needed extra hardware to now service it. As a bonus, you'd get a lot better telescope
     as Hubble hardware is fairly ancient by modern standards.</p>
     
     <h3>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h3>
     <p>In all likelihood, no. There are lots of reasons why this would not work: Dragon does not carry enough
     fuel to reboost the station, the SuperDraco engines are far too powerful, the docking ports Dragon use are
     incapable of handling the force, the Dragon would not be firing through the station's center of mass, and the
     Dragon does not have the necessary connections to provide station Guidance, Navigation, & Control. Current 
     solutions to reboosting work perfectly fine. Using Dragon would be too complicated and requires too much effort,
     whereas current solutions of reboosting the ISS are perfectly capable of doing so without modification.</p>
     
     <h3>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h3>
     <p>According to Hans Koenigsmann at the Dragon Pad Abort press conference, the Dragon 2 weighs 21000 lbs (9525 kg), 
     3500 lbs (1588 kg) of which is propellant. Assuming the SuperDracos have an specific impulse of 235 s, that means the
     total delta-v of the Dragon 2 is 420 m/s.</p>
     
     <h3>What is Red Dragon?</h3>
     <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian
     surface. The mission would be an unmanned scientific lander, and the heaviest object ever to be placed on Mars - it alone could 
     carry an additional 2 metric tons of cargo and equipment down to the surface. There have been no official announcements about the
     mission from SpaceX as the mission design architecture is not managed by them, and there is currently no indication that the project 
     will be funded.</p>
