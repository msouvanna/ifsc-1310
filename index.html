  <h2>Dragon Project Revision & Reflection</h2>
  <p>Working on this Dragon project was the testament of my knowledge of HTML and CSS.  As I worked through the previous projects 
  (leading up to this one), I learned so many new things about a field that I hadn’t even worked on previously.  It was fun learning
  new things and being able to see your hard work pay off.  As I was working on the Dragon project, I realized that HTML was more than
  just a few headers and paragraphs.  It was about the connection between each individual element and how they all worked together to
  make the webpage run as smoothly as possible.  

  Some of the things that I did well on was formatting the content and strategically placing images/quotes/articles onto my webpage.
  However, if I had to start all over from scratch, I’d try to not get caught up with every little detail since that slows me down and 
  wastes my time.  Whenever I do that, I sometimes neglect the other aspects of my project.  Other than that, I wouldn’t change a thing
  since I believe I was working fine on my project.
  
  From the feedback that I got from my family member, they said that I did well with the inner workings of the webpages (smooth transition
  from 1 page to another) and the content wasn’t too overwhelming and placed nice.  However, they said that the color scheme wasn’t matching
  the vibe of the webpages.  Because of the theme of space exploration, they said that the colors should have darker hues rather than having
  lighter hues such as yellow/orange on the pages.  In order to fix the color scheme problem, I changed my color scheme completely.  I opted 
  in for more darker hues such as dark blue and dark green.  From their feedback, I was able to make this webpage aesthetically pleasing to 
  the human eye without the colors being too bright..</p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is an idea of web development that shifts the emphasis of web design to the webpages’ web content. 
    This means that it doesn’t focus on the web browser itself.  Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because 
    there are older browsers and mobile devices that cannot handle the “aesthetics” side of your webpage (ex: CSS/JS).  So by focusing on
    the web contents instead,  you’ll be able to bring out the most out of your web content which will allow ALL users—regardless of their
    device/web browser and its functionality—to enjoy and view your webpage.
